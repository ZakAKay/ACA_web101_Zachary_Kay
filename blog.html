        <h3>Epiphanies I had when writing CSS</h3>
        <small>posted by Zak 6/5/22</small>
            <p> An epiphanie I had while writing in CSS was when I was creating the grid system. Using percentages are easier but if your not careful columns will go out of the screen. When using fractions they fit perfictly and are more precise.</p>
